// Tutorial: Lead
// Destroy the enemy ship. Its position is given by the "target" function and velocity by the
// "target_velocity" function. Your ship is not able to accelerate in this scenario.
//
// This is where the game becomes challenging! You'll need to lead the target
// by firing towards where the target will be by the time the bullet gets there.
//
// Hint: target() + target_velocity() * t gives the position of the target after t seconds.
//
// You can scale a vector by a number: vec2(a, b) * c == vec2(a * c, b * c)
//
// p.s. You can change your username by clicking on it at the top of the page.
